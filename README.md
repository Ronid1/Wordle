# Wordle Clone With Flexible Board Size
This project is a Wordle game that allows user to choose the board size at the beginning of each round (length of word and num of attempts).

The app is built primarily using react, with some node.js for the server side. words are fetched from [RapidAPI Random Words API](https://rapidapi.com/sheharyar566/api/random-words5/), and guesses are cross-checked in [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
